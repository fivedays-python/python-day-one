# Predict the output

```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x // y)
print(x % y)
```

## Explanation and Solution:

Integer Division (//):

The // operator performs floor division, which divides two numbers and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
Calculation: 10 // 3 equals 3 because 3 * 3 = 9, and 10 divided by 3 is approximately 3.333, but floor division truncates the decimal part.
Modulus Operator (%):

The % operator returns the remainder of the division.
Calculation: 10 % 3 equals 1 because 3 * 3 = 9, and 10 - 9 = 1.

```python
3
1
```

## Explanation

* The first print() statement outputs 3, the result of 10 // 3.
* The second print() statement outputs 1, the remainder of 10 % 3.
