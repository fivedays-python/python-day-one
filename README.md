# Day 1 Agenda: Introduction to Python and Basic Syntax

Welcome to Day 1 of our 5-day Python course! Today, we'll embark on our programming journey by exploring the fundamentals of Python. This session is designed to introduce you to the basic syntax of Python, how to work with variables and data types, and how to perform basic operations.

## **Schedule**

1. ### **Introduction to Programming and Python** 
   - **Topics:**
     - What is programming?
     - Overview of Python and its applications.

2. ### **Basic Syntax and Structure** 
   - **Topics:**
     - Writing your first Python script.
     - The `print()` function.
     - Comments and the importance of indentation.

3. ### **Variables and Data Types** 
   - **Topics:**
     - Variable naming conventions.
     - Data types: integers, floats, strings, booleans.
     - Type casting between data types.

4. ### **Basic Operators** 
   - **Topics:**
     - Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`).
     - Assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.).
     - Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`).

     - Display a personalized greeting message.

7. ### **Wrap-Up and Q&A** 
   - **Topics:**
     - Recap of key concepts learned.
     - Open session for questions and clarifications.

## **Materials Needed**

- **Coding Platform:** Access to [Replit](https://replit.com/) for online coding.
- **No prior setup required** as we'll be coding directly in the browser.

## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of today's session, you should be able to:

- Understand the basics of programming and how Python fits in.
- Write and run simple Python scripts.
- Declare variables and work with different data types.
- Perform basic arithmetic and logical operations.
- Interact with users through input and output functions.
